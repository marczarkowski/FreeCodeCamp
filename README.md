## Front-end Projects: My journey to mastery

The main purpose of this repository is to document all I do to improve my programming skills in field of front-end development.  

### What you can find on this repo?
+ In [**projects**](https://github.com/mkczarkowski/front-end-projects/tree/master/projects) directory there are all of my stand-alone side-projects that I did to practice newly acquired knowledge.
+ In [**algorithm-challenges**](https://github.com/mkczarkowski/front-end-projects/tree/master/algorithm-challenges) directory there are code katas that I did to improve my problem solving skills.
+ In [**courses**](https://github.com/mkczarkowski/front-end-projects/tree/master/courses) directory there are exercises that I completed during courses and bootcamps. I always do them by myself and check solution afterwards. 
I'm deep believer in learning by deliberate practice, not rewriting someone else work. 
You will also find some notes in polish which I did to practice translation from english to polish and improve information retention.
